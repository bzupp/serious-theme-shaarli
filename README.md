# Serious Theme for Shaarli

This is a serious and simple theme for [Shaarli](https://github.com/shaarli/Shaarli), a free software, minimalist bookmark sharing site.

You can use the [DejaVu Sans Light](http://dejavu-fonts.org/wiki/Main_Page) font (found on most GNU/Linux distributions) if you'd like your Daily Shaarli to look nice.

* I removed the option for Unicode icons, as this decision will be made in Shaarli itself later on.
